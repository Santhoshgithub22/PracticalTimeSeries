# PracticalTimeSeries  

These notebooks are derived from the coursera course [Practical Time Series](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-time-series-analysis/home/welcome) from the State University of NewYork. 

I went through the material in 1 week and by the end of the week, I felt like I was confident enough to add time series to my resume. Obviously, you may be able to go through faster, since I was also deriving the equations and writing the notebooks you will find here. 

The notebooks go from basic concepts to more advanced and I have used labels 1, 2, .... to ease the navigation. 

The End-To-End Examples will walk you through real life cases. The most complete case is the Johnson & Johnson example.
